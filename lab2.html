	<p><b>According to a report by Nature journal, several pre-print publications tell that Omicron is “totally or partially resistant to all currently available treatments based on these monoclonal antibodies”. As a result, many manufacturers of antibody therapy have already conceded their products due to a much lower potency against Omicron, as compared to other variants.</b>The only two antibodies that show strong evidence, the report stated, were sotrovimab, developed by Vir Biotechnology in San Francisco, California, and GSK, headquartered in London; and DXP-604.In the case of Omicron, the concentration of the treatment which should cut viral replication in half, could not even reach the threshold, even with increased concentration, researchers quoted in the report said.</p><i>“We didn’t expect to see such a shift in the antibodies’ effectiveness,”</i> said Olivier Schwartz, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and a co-author of one of the pre-prints.<br/>
